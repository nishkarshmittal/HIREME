Our flagship product, USDe, is a synthetic dollar backed by digital assets, and takes the novel approach of using a delta-neutral hedged basis strategy to maintain its peg. This product scaled from zero to $15b in 18 months. Expanding on this, iUSDe is designed specifically for traditional financial institutions, incorporating necessary compliance features to enable them to access the crypto-native rewards our protocol generates, in an institutional-friendly manner. Ethena has also developed USDtb: a fiat backed GENIUS compliant stablecoin in partnership with BlackRock which has scaled to ~$2b. These products are also offered in a whitelabel stablecoin offering where any application, chain, wallet or exchange can launch their own stablecoin on Ethena's back-end infrastructure. Through these offerings, Ethena Labs is not just creating new financial products; we are building the foundational infrastructure for a more open, efficient, and interconnected global financial system. Open job offerings will be focused on two new major product lines coming to market in the next few months. Join us!! The Senior Data Engineer is a critical role reporting directly to the CTO. The primary mission is to rapidly deliver a reliable, production-ready market data platform that serves as the single source of truth for trading, risk, and business intelligence. Youâll immediately own the entire data platform from inception and deliver working historical and real-time Tardis pipelines in the first 60 days. Beyond the initial MVP, the role requires iteratively evolving the platform into a best-in-class, cloud-native, observable, and self-service system. You will work hand in hand with the CTO & trading team to scope & deliver to business needs. The Senior Data Engineer will also serve as the go-to data expert for the firm and will be responsible for mentoring future junior data engineers or analysts. \n What Youâll Do Rapidly spin up the cloud environment. Deliver working historical backfill pipelines from Tardis.dev into a queryable database. Deliver a real-time Tardis WebSocket pipeline, ensuring data is normalized, cached for live consumption, accurate, replayable, and queryable by Day 60. Ensure all pipelines are idempotent, retryable, and use exactly-once semantics. Implement full CI/CD, Terraform, automated testing, and secrets management. Implement proper observability (structured logs, metrics, dashboards, alerting) from day one. Provide immediate self-service access to the MVP database for Trading and BI teams via tools like Tableau/Metabase, and through simple internal REST APIs. Develop specialized timeseries data, including USDe backing-asset and a full opportunity-surface timeseries for Delta-neutral/lending/borrow opportunities. Ingest data from additional sources (Kaiko, CoinAPI, on-chain via TheGraph/Dune). Plan for 10x+ data growth via schema evolution, partitioning, and performance tuning. Establish enterprise-grade governance, including a data quality framework, RBAC, audit logs, and a semantic layer. Create full architecture documentation, runbooks, and a data dictionary. Onboard and mentor future junior staff. What Weâre Looking For Proven track record of delivering working, production data in weeks, not months, with the ability to ruthlessly cut scope to hit a 60-day MVP while managing technical debt. Have built Tardis historical and real-time pipelines before (or equivalent high-quality crypto market data feeds), understanding specific quirks, rate limits, and WebSocket structures. Expert in large-scale, reliable ETL/ELT for financial or market data. Fluent in provisioning full environments with Terraform in days and expert in AWS/GCP serverless technologies. Expert Python and SQL skills and proficiency with time-series databases like TimescaleDB or ClickHouse, ensuring fast queries from day one. Advanced knowledge of WebSocket clients, message queues, and low-latency streaming, GitOps, automated testing/deploy and observability practices. Significant understanding of stablecoins, lending protocols, and opportunity surface concepts, or a proven ability to ramp up extremely quickly. \n Why Ethena Labs? You'd be joining a group that has well established itself as one of the most successful crypto-native company's of all time, a group with a mission to revolutionise decentralised finance and it's position in global finance. Work alongside a passionate and innovative team that values collaboration and creativity. Enjoy a flexible, remote-friendly work environment with established opportunities for personal growth and learning.

RemoteOK,Product Manager,Conduit,,2025-12-10T11:00:01+00:00,,https://remoteOK.com/remote-jobs/remote-product-manager-conduit-1129162,"Conduit At Conduit, we're building the crypto-native cloud platform that will scale Ethereum. Crypto builders have been held back by a lack of onchain compute â without the ability to process a high volume of transactions quickly and cheaply, onchain apps and ecosystems canât build high quality user experiences. Rollups have emerged as the answer to this problem. Just as servers work together to scale compute in web2, so too can rollups scale onchain compute in web3. But building and operating your own rollup is difficult and time-consuming. That's where Conduit comes in. As the rollup-native cloud platform, Conduit combines web2 engineering best-practices with web3 rollup technology to make it easy for anyone to launch and maintain their own chain. By making infrastructure simple and onchain compute abundant, similar to how AWS and GCP did for web2, we can unlock the next wave of innovation in the crypto ecosystem. The Conduit platform has seen massive growth since going live in 2023. We run the largest chains in production, including Proof of Play, Zora, Aevo, and more . This translates to 200+ chains across mainnet and testnet and over $1B in total-value-locked (TVL). We're operating on the bleeding edge of crypto, co-evolving with our customers and integration partners, and pushing the limits of blockchain scalability and modularity. This success has been recognized and accelerated through a $37M Series A , co-led by Paradigm and Haun Ventures â two of the best investors in the industry. Weâre an elite team thatâs previously worked at Meta, Brex, Wish, Compound, Chainalysis, Immunefi, Amazon, Avara/Aave, Paradigm, and more. Weâre headquartered in San Francisco, with team members all over the world. Weâre looking for ambitious, talented builders that want to help scale Ethereum and bring crypto compute to the masses. Join us! About the Role Weâre looking for a Product Manager to join Conduit and drive product development across our core infrastructure platform. This role will work closely with our CEO, GTM, engineering, and operations teams to define, prioritize, and execute on initiatives that scale our platform and deliver value to enterprise-grade customers building on Ethereum. This is a high-impact, cross-functional role â perfect for someone who thrives in early-stage environments but understands how to build with the structure and discipline of an enterprise product organization. Youâll be driving key product initiatives from concept to launch, and ensuring Conduit continues to lead the way in crypto infrastructure. What Youâll Do Lead cross-functional product initiatives from 0 â 1, defining scope, requirements, and success metrics. Partner closely with engineering to align technical capabilities with customer needs. Bring product clarity and structure to a fast-moving organization â reducing diffusion of responsibility and ensuring end-to-end ownership of outcomes. Collaborate with the GTM team to shape product positioning, write product copy, and translate technical concepts into clear, compelling narratives. Drive prioritization and tradeoff decisions â negotiating whatâs in and whatâs out â balancing speed, scope, and quality. Work with CEO on translating product vision and strategy into executable roadmaps that scale Conduitâs enterprise offering. Develop a deep understanding of our customers, their infrastructure needs, and the broader Ethereum and rollup ecosystem. Contribute to internal product process and frameworks to make product development more seamless, data-informed, and customer-driven. What Weâre Looking For 5+ years of experience as a Product Manager, ideally in B2B or infrastructure-focused companies (e.g. platform, data, or developer tooling products). Strong product sense with experience taking products from concept â launch. Proven ability to manage complex, technical products â understanding constraints and collaborating with engineering to find elegant, feasible solutions. Detail-oriented and organized â capable of driving clarity and alignment across teams. Excellent written and verbal communication skills, including technical documentation and product marketing copy. A bias toward action and accountability â thrives in environments where you own outcomes. Interest in learning about web3, Ethereum, and onchain infrastructure.

Baymard Institute conducts large-scale UX research studies, sharing our findings through a bespoke B2B SaaS platform that serves 2,000+ retailer stores, brands, and agencies across 80+ countries — including 71% of Fortune 500 ecommerce companies. We’re fully distributed, with ~60 team members spanning America and Europe, all committed to advancing ecommerce UX. About The Role As Baymard’s Content Marketing Manager, you’ll own the stories that connect our research, tools, and product roadmap to the people who use them. Your core focus will be turning complex UX and product insights into clear, compelling narratives that drive qualified demand, product activation, and long-term trust. You’ll plan and produce content across key formats — long-form articles, landing pages, email, and thought leadership — with SEO as a core distribution lever, not the sole objective . Working closely with Growth, Product, and Research, you’ll help shape our editorial strategy, structure content around real user problems, and ensure that every piece has a clear job in the funnel. This role is a good fit if you’re as comfortable digging into product behavior and user journeys as you are crafting a sharp headline. You’ll balance search strategy, storytelling, and product understanding to create content that both ranks and resonates. Who You Are You’re first and foremost an exceptional copywriter and storyteller . You know how to make complex topics feel accessible, concrete, and useful — without slipping into generic SaaS jargon. You bring hands-on experience from a SaaS environment , ideally in a product-led or self-serve context, and you think naturally in terms of user value, time-to-value, and feature adoption. When you write, you’re not just filling a content calendar; you’re helping users understand what the product does, why it matters, and how to get value from it. You’re confident working with SEO fundamentals — search intent, topic clusters, internal linking, and on-page structure — but you don’t treat SEO as a checklist. You’re comfortable collaborating with growth and product teams, responding to data and user signals, and iterating based on what actually moves the needle. You may also enjoy experimenting with new formats (video, short-form social, digital PR angles) and thinking about how one core story can live across multiple channels — from the blog, to the product, to lifecycle email. What You'll Need 3+ years of experience in content marketing or copywriting for B2B SaaS (ideally product-led or self-serve). Demonstrated ability to translate complex products or research into clear, engaging narratives . Strong understanding of SEO basics (search intent, keyword research, content structure, internal linking) and how content can compound over time. Experience creating content across the funnel: from educational and problem-focused pieces to product and conversion-focused assets. Proven ability to collaborate with Product, Growth/Marketing, and Sales to shape content that supports both user and business goals. Comfortable using analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics, HubSpot, search tools) to inform topics, measure performance, and refine strategy. Fully proficient in written and spoken English. Nice-To-Haves Experience with digital PR or earning coverage/backlinks through research or content. Comfortable with video storyboarding (e.g., product explainers, educational videos, YouTube scripts). Experience creating short-form content for social channels (e.g., LinkedIn, X) from core long-form pieces. Familiarity with email and lifecycle communications (onboarding flows, activation nudges, product education, and light-touch nurture). Background in ecommerce, UX research, or related product/experience-led domains. Practical Details Location: 100% remote, full-time position, from EU, UK, or IE. (Be mindful that the role requires daily overlap with team members European time zones.) Language: We expect you to be fully proficient in written and spoken English. Salary: Based on qualifications. Start date: As soon as possible. Travel: Is limited; expect only 1-2 weeks of travel each year (often only in connection with the company-wide meetup). Company: Learn more about Baymard’s work culture and values here . Also, consider signing up for a free Baymard account to explore our product.
